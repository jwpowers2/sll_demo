# Demo of a Singly Linked List in Python

## a call queue for a call center

### call comes in and call object is inserted in a a node of the SLL

### there is no tracking of tail as of second commit

### maybe make a stock ticker which uses an SLL and Flask

## static queue where last becomes first in perpetual loop

### SLL has a node for all stocks 
### flask displays the first 5
### for each of these they are updated for minute interval and then after out of 
### group of 5 their data is deleted
### remove last and make it head to move the queue
